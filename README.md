# BoardForScanner — React UI Template

A clean and reusable **React + Vite UI template** built with **JavaScript (JSX)**.  
This project focuses **only on interface and state structure**, without business logic or backend integration.

It was designed as a **UI foundation** for future projects where logic, APIs, or scanning engines can be plugged in later.

---

## Features

- Modular component-based architecture
- State management using **Context API + reducers**
- Stepper / multi-step UI system
- Dashboard-style layout
- Reusable UI components
- Clean and consistent JSX structure
- No backend / no business logic (UI only)

---
## Purpose

This repository is intended to be used as:

- A UI prototype
- A starter template for React projects
- A frontend-only layout for dashboards or scanning systems
- A showcase of clean React architecture

All logic-related layers (API, services, scanning engines, auth, etc.) are intentionally excluded.
